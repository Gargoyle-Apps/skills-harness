# Migrating an existing manual install to subtree

Use when a repo already has `.skills/` (installed by file-copy from an earlier kit version) and you want to switch to subtree-vendored updates **without losing consumer-authored skills, the index, or `_meta.yml`**.

The kit ships a helper: **`.skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh`**. It is **dry-run by default** — it inventories the repo, classifies each skill as kit-bundled vs. consumer-authored, and prints exactly what it would change. Re-run with `--apply` to perform the changes.

## Bootstrapping the script on a stale install

Older harness installs (pre-0.6.0) don't ship `migrate-to-subtree.sh`. Pull it from upstream into the existing `.skills/_harness/` directory before running:

```bash
curl -sSLo .skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gargoyle-Apps/skills-harness/v1.5.0/.skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh
chmod +x .skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh
```

The script's dirty-tree check ignores its own untracked file plus any `*.bak/` directories, so dropping it directly into `.skills/_harness/` and running from there is fine. Use `main` in the URL only for bleeding-edge testing; prefer a kit release tag (e.g. `v1.5.0`) for reproducible installs.

## Stale `repo_url` in `.skills/_meta.yml`

Legacy manual installs frequently carry an outdated upstream URL — typically a fork or pre-rename location that is no longer reachable (e.g. `gotalab/skills-harness`, which 404s). When migrating these repos to subtree, the script will **refuse** to vendor any URL that doesn't contain `Gargoyle-Apps/skills-harness`. **This is expected**, not a bug in the consumer's repo.

The standard fix when adopting the official upstream:

```bash
.skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh \
  --remote-url https://github.com/Gargoyle-Apps/skills-harness \
  --apply --reconcile --symlink-consumer-skills
```

`--reconcile` rewrites `.skills/_meta.yml` so `repo_url` and `kit_version` match the vendored subtree, so no manual edit is needed afterwards.

`--accept-derived-url` exists only for the rare case where a team **deliberately** maintains a private fork at the URL `_meta.yml` lists and wants to vendor that fork. **Do not use `--accept-derived-url` to silence the canonical check on a stale install** — the subtree add will fail if the URL is dead, or (worse) silently vendor the wrong tree.

## What it changes (apply mode)

- Adds the upstream remote (`skills-harness` by default; URL pulled from `.skills/_meta.yml` `repo_url` or `--remote-url`).
- Runs `git subtree add --prefix=.skills-harness <remote> <ref> --squash` (one squash commit, fully reversible with `git revert`).
- For each **kit-owned** target:
  - `.skills/_harness/` is moved aside to `.skills/_harness.bak/` and replaced with a symlink into the subtree.
  - For each kit-bundled skill (`skill-template`, `skill-author`, `harness-upgrade`, `kit-release`, `harness-subtree`): if the local copy is **byte-identical** to upstream, it is moved to `<name>.bak/` and replaced with a symlink. If the local copy **differs** (you hand-edited it, or you're on an older kit version), the script **leaves the local copy in place** and prints the diff command. Two ways to accept upstream after review:
    - `--accept-upstream <name>[,<name>…] --apply` — surgical: backup-and-symlink only the listed skills.
    - `--force --apply` — sledgehammer: backup-and-symlink **every** drifted kit skill in one pass.

## What it never touches

- **Consumer-authored skills** (any directory under `.skills/_skills/` whose name is not in the kit-bundled set) — left exactly as they are.
- **`.skills/_index.md`** and **`.skills/_meta.yml`** — consumer-owned. By default the script prints a reconcile checklist instead of editing them. Pass **`--reconcile`** to opt in to automated kit-row merge + `kit_version`/`repo_url` bump (consumer rows and other `_meta.yml` fields stay verbatim).
- **Native discovery symlink directories** (`.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`).

## What it audits (warns, never modifies)

- **Prefix convention** (per **skill-author**): for every consumer-authored skill, the script checks the name against the repo's allowed prefix set:
  - **Default (single-prefix repos):** the expected prefix is derived from the repo's root directory name (split on `-`/`_`, first letter of each segment, lowercased, append `-`). In a repo named `eng-package-management`, a skill called `deploy-checklist` triggers `→ suggested rename: epm-deploy-checklist`.
  - **Multi-prefix repos:** if `.skills/_meta.yml` declares a `prefixes:` list (e.g. `[bld-, bin-]`), the script accepts **any** of those prefixes and ignores the auto-derived one. A violation message lists all declared prefixes so the user can pick the family the skill belongs to. Kit-bundled skills stay unprefixed in either mode.

  Renaming is a manual, deliberate step — the script never renames automatically because the index, frontmatter, and any cross-skill `dependencies` references all need to update together.
- **Frontmatter shape**: each consumer SKILL.md is checked for the five required fields (`name`, `description`, `triggers`, `dependencies`, `version`) and that `name` matches the directory. Missing fields are reported so you can patch them up against the current `skill-template`.

## Workflow

1. **Audit first** (no changes):

   ```bash
   .skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh
   ```

   Read the output. Note any kit skills flagged as drifted, and any consumer skills flagged for prefix or frontmatter issues.

2. **Decide on drifted kit skills.** For each drift report, run the suggested `diff -ru` command. If your edits should be upstreamed, contribute them and pull a new release later. If your edits are throwaway/local and you want the upstream version, plan to re-run with `--accept-upstream <name>` (per-skill) or `--force` (all drifted skills).

3. **Fix prefix and frontmatter issues** *before* the migration if possible — it keeps the index reconcile (step 6) cleaner. For each prefix warning:
   - `git mv .skills/_skills/<name> .skills/_skills/<prefix><name>`
   - Edit `<prefix><name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter: set `name: <prefix><name>`
   - Update `.skills/_index.md` row name
   - Search for `dependencies:` mentions of the old name across `.skills/_skills/*/SKILL.md` and update them
   - Run `.skills/_harness/check.sh` to confirm

4. **Apply** (clean working tree required; the script ignores its own untracked file and `*.bak/` dirs):

   ```bash
   .skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh --apply
   .skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh --apply --accept-upstream skill-author,skill-template
   .skills/_harness/migrate-to-subtree.sh --apply --force
   ```

   To collapse steps 6–7 (manual `_index.md` reconcile and `_meta.yml` bump) into the same run, add `--reconcile`. To also generate `.skills/_skills/<name>/` shim symlinks when `consumer_skills_dir:` is declared, add `--symlink-consumer-skills`. Both are dry-run-friendly; preview first, then re-run with `--apply`.

5. **Inspect the backups.** The script left `.skills/_harness.bak/` and any `.skills/_skills/<name>.bak/` directories so you can confirm nothing important was lost. Once happy, `rm -rf` them in a follow-up commit (or keep them on a separate branch).

6. **Reconcile `.skills/_index.md`.** Open `.skills-harness/.skills/_index.md` (the upstream, kit-only index) side by side with your `.skills/_index.md`. Make sure every kit-bundled skill row in the upstream index appears in your local index, and that every consumer-authored skill row in your local index is preserved. Do **not** simply overwrite — your local file is the union.

7. **Bump `.skills/_meta.yml`** `kit_version` to match `.skills-harness/.skills/_meta.yml` (or pin lower and document why).

8. **Re-link native discovery** if you use it (`link.sh` is now a symlink into the subtree, so just call it):

   ```bash
   .skills/_harness/link.sh .agents/skills    # or .claude/skills
   # or sync every existing native dir and validate in one step:
   .skills/_harness/check.sh --link
   ```

9. **Validate:**

   ```bash
   .skills/_harness/check.sh
   ```

10. **Commit.** Two commits are usually clearest: the squashed `subtree add` commit (created by step 4) and a follow-up commit for the symlinks, index reconcile, `_meta.yml` bump, and `.bak` cleanup.

From this point on, updates are `git subtree pull` — load `references/update-vendored-kit.md`.
