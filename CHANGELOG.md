# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **`AGENTS_skills.md` Path B — agnostic / multi-ecosystem:** author portable skills under `.skills/` without installing a tool-specific harness in the repo; document in README/CONTRIBUTING and remove bootstrap.
- **README:** subsection for agnostic repositories and downstream harness usage.

### Changed

- **`skill-author` prerequisites:** allow completion via Path A or Path B (`AGENTS_skills.md`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- **Bootstrap renamed to `AGENTS_skills.md`** so it does not overwrite an existing project `AGENTS.md`. It is removed after setup.
- **AGENTS-based harness:** templates now require **merging** into existing `AGENTS.md` when that file already exists; sidecar templates merge pointers into `AGENTS.md` the same way.
- **`AGENTS_skills.md` gate:** explicit rules that the user must **declare the environment** before any skill creation, refactor, or index registration; runtime harness rules repeat this while the bootstrap file is present.
- **skill-author:** prerequisites section pointing at the bootstrap gate.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Bootstrap `AGENTS.md` and `.skills/` layout: index, bundled skills (`skill-template`, `skill-author`), and environment templates under `.skills/_harness/`.
- Human-facing `README` with quick start, supported tools, and optional MCP pointer.
